# Cement Plant Dust Emissions Optimization

This project aimed to **reduce atmospheric dust emissions** in a cement packaging plant by identifying and optimizing key operational parameters using **SQL** and **Python**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To analyze plant performance data, identify variables that influence dust emissions the most, implement changes, and evaluate the results.

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- MySQL (Data management and querying)
- Jupyter Notebook (Analysis and storytelling)

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

- Dust concentration (mg/m³)
- Inlet gas flow rate (m³/hr)
- Temperature (°C)
- Differential pressure (kPa)
- Residue (%) – a cement fineness metric

---

## 🔍 Analytical Approach

1. Data cleaning and preparation in SQL
2. Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis in Python
3. Regression modeling to understand key influences
4. Visualization of pre- and post-optimization results
5. Suggested operational recommendations

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Dust emissions strongly correlated with [insert top features once analysis is complete]
- Optimization steps led to a measurable reduction in dust levels
- Recommendations generated for real-time decision-making
